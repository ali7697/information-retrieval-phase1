# information-retrieval-phase1
In this project, I have implemented an information retrieval system that searches within a collection of 50,000 Farsi news articles. 
During the first phase of the project in the first step, the news articles are tokenized and normalized using different techniques. Then an inverted index dictionary is built after removing the stop words. This inverted index dictionary consists of terms as keys and news article ids as the values. Finally, the user queries are processed in a boolean manner, and news URLs of the retrieved news are shown to the user.
